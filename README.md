# Exploring-Yelp-Dataset
A collection of R &amp; Python Codes exploring the review &amp; business datasets provided by Yelp.

Data Courtesy: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

A collection of 8M reviews and 300k Businesses, the documentation tab on this link gives much insight about the schema/ structure of the files. These are all in the .tar format and hence had to be unzipped to the individual json files first. I have only used the Review and Business Datasets for the purpose of this work. My codes also kind of walk through the trials and tribulations I faced to get to the filters I wanted to use and the chunksizes etc. 

I will also be posting a python file analyzing the same dataset. The point of using both these tools is to really delve into the capabilities of both when it comes to handling large datasets. Eventually this has to be downsized in the interest of the possibilities of a local machine.

This is a developing document yet.
